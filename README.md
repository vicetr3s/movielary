Movielary 🍿🎬📚

Learn vocabulary from movies. A React app that turns movies into flashcards.

About 🎥

Movielary is a personal project built with React, CSS and HTML. It uses the TMDB API to fetch movie data and create an interactive list of movies. Once a movie is selected, the application uses the OpenSubtitles API to extract keywords from the subtitles. These words are then defined using a dictionary API and transformed into simple cards.
