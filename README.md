## About ðŸŽ¥

Movielary is a personal project built with React, CSS and HTML. It uses the TMDB API to fetch movie data and create an interactive list of movies. Once a movie is selected, the application uses the OpenSubtitles API to extract keywords from the subtitles. These words are then defined using a dictionary API and transformed into simple cards.

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- Movie Search: Discover your favorite movies using the TMDB API.
- Flashcard Generation: Create flashcards based on movie vocabulary.
- Interactive Flashcards: Flip through cards to learn new words.
- Clean and User-Friendly Interface: Enjoy a simple and intuitive design.
